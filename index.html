        <h3>Event Cancelled</h3>
        <p>Regretfully, we are announcing the cancellation of the 2020 AHCS-EAS graduate student symposium. Quebec and McGill, like many other locations and institutions, have prohibited travel and gatherings to an extent that would make our event impossible, not to mention inadvisable. In recognition that the situation is unlikely to resolve in the next four weeks and in the interest of reducing both health risk and stressful uncertainty, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to cancel Containment &amp; Intimacy.</p>
        <p>We would like to thank our presenters and invited speakers for their patience and understanding as we have considered how to respond to the evolving COVID-19 situation. A collection of abstracts for accepted presentations will appear on this site in the coming weeks, and we hope that it will facilitate exchange among this great group of researchers.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,<br />Containment &amp; Intimacy Organizing Committee<br />(March 18, 2020)</p>
